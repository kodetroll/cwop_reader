First, find a wx station near to the location you wish to monitor:
Go to https://madis-data.noaa.gov/sfc_display/ and zoom in until you locate 
a station. The station id is the important thing to note. Look for ones that
are of the form DXXXX and not KXXX (the latter are airport wx stations and
are not in the wxqa db).

Next check to see if your selected station is in the wxqa db:
Goto 'http://wxqa.com/search.htm' and enter the station id as noted from the
step above and click 'Search'. You should end up on a page with several lines
of garbled looking text, like this:

DW6507>APRS,TCPXX*,qAX,CWOP-3:@281755z3029.90N/08629.21W_047/003g006t056r000p000P000h52b10249L761.DsIP-VP
4/72 data packets and 0/0 duplicates; 420/7560 bytes

Each line should start with your station's call, which is based on the ID we
used to search on. If you see this, then your station is being tracked, or 
has data anyway. 

Edit the config file 'local.cfg' (following the instruction therein) to 
update the station ID (IDNUM) value with your selected station's ID.
